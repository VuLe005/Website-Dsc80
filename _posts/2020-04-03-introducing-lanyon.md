What is Leauge of Legends?

Leauge of Legends is a 5v5 MOBA game, where a team strives to break the enemies nexus to win. Each person has
a role that they need to efficiently fufill, such as tanks, damage dealers, and supports. We will be focusing
mostly on tanks and supports for our data.

Our hypothesis question is: Do tanks/bruiser have higher damage mitigated per minute compared to tanky supports?

Why does this matter?

To a person who doesn't play games, it won't matter much. But to a person who plays leauge of legends, by understanding
how impactfull a tank/bruiser is compared to a tanky support, may help in creating a strategic team full of optimal
champions that may be better than the current optimal team.
